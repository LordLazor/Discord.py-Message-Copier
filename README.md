# Discord.py-Message-Copier
Simple message copier which can be used to log channel messages

### How to use it
* Paste your bots Token in 'TOKEN' 
* Start the bot
* Type .grab into the text channel you want to copy
* Behind .grab needs to be an amount given (standard is 20) - You can type whatever number you want
* A .txt file will generate in which you can find the copied messages

- I recommend not to use an amount above 100!
